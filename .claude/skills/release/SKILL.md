# Knockoff release

Ships one version to all three stores. `manifest.json` `.version` is the single
source of truth; everything else (Safari `MARKETING_VERSION`, the CWS version
gate, release notes headings, the git tag) keys off it.

## Step 0 — Preflight (before asking the user anything)

Run all of these; collect failures instead of stopping at the first one.

1. Git: working tree clean, on `main`, and in sync with `origin/main`
   (`git fetch origin && git status`). Dirty tree or unpushed/unpulled commits
   = hard stop.
2. Tests: `node tests/run.js` must pass.
3. Listing gate: `node scripts/render-listing.js --check` must pass.
4. Firefox lint: `./scripts/release-firefox.sh --lint-only` must exit 0
   (warnings are fine; errors block).
5. Credentials, per store:
   - **Chrome:** `gh auth status` works. The five `CWS_*` GitHub secrets are
     assumed present (uploaded via `scripts/upload-secrets.sh`); local
     `.env.cws` is only needed for status checks.
   - **Firefox:** `.env.amo` exists with `AMO_JWT_ISSUER` and `AMO_JWT_SECRET`
     (see First-run setup below).
   - **Safari:** running on macOS; `.env.asc` exists with `ASC_KEY_ID`,
     `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, and the `.p8` at `ASC_KEY_FILE` (or the default
     `~/.appstoreconnect/AuthKey_<KEY_ID>.p8`); Xcode signed into team
     `W33JZPPPFN`. Ships macOS **and** iOS/iPadOS: the shared schemes
     `Knockoff` and `Knockoff iOS` both exist, the ASC app record has the iOS
     platform enabled, and iOS screenshots (iPhone 6.9" + iPad 13") are
     uploaded (the preflight can't verify screenshots — eyeball them).

If a store's credentials are missing, do not silently skip it — tell the user
what's missing and ask whether to release without that store or abort.

## Step 1 — Decide the version (ask the user)

1. Find the last release: latest `git tag -l 'v*' | sort -V | tail -1`. If no
   tags exist yet (first skill-driven release), use the commit that last
   changed the `"version"` line in `manifest.json`
   (`git log -1 -S'"version"' --format=%H -- manifest.json`).
2. List commits since then: `git log <ref>..HEAD --oneline`.
3. Suggest a bump: new user-visible features → minor; only fixes/tweaks →
   patch; anything ambiguous → ask.
4. Ask the user ONE consolidated question round: (a) version — Patch / Minor /
   Major / Custom, with the suggested option first and the commit list shown;
   (b) Apple release timing — MANUAL (default; you click "Release" in App
   Store Connect after approval) or AFTER_APPROVAL (auto-release).

## Step 2 — Release notes

File: `store-assets/release-notes.md` (canonical "what's new" for all three
stores; AMO notes are read from it automatically by `release-firefox.sh`).

1. Check `## Unreleased` covers every user-visible change since the last
   release. Draft missing entries from the commit list — user-facing prose in
   the style of the existing entries ("New: …", plain English, no commit
   prefixes, drop internal/infra changes entirely).
2. Show the final notes to the user and confirm before writing.
3. Roll: rename `## Unreleased` to `## <version>` and insert a fresh empty
   `## Unreleased` above it.

Never skip this step, even for a "trivial" release.

## Step 3 — Bump, commit, tag, push

1. Edit `manifest.json` `.version` to the new version.
2. Run `./scripts/update-bundled-brands.sh` — bakes the current curated
   community list into `data/community-brands.js` so fresh installs start
   with the same list existing installs have. If it fails (API unreachable),
   warn the user and continue with the committed snapshot; a stale bundle is
   not a release blocker.
3. Run `./scripts/sync-safari.sh` — this is what carries the version into the
   Xcode project (`MARKETING_VERSION`) and syncs the extension resources.
   Never edit `MARKETING_VERSION` by hand.
4. Run `node scripts/build-changelog.js` — regenerates
   `site/public/changelog.html` from `store-assets/release-notes.md` (rolled in
   Step 2), dating each version from its `v<version>` tag. The version being
   released has no tag yet, so it's dated today — correct on release day.
5. Re-run `node scripts/render-listing.js --check` and `node tests/run.js`.
6. Commit everything as `Release v<version>` (including the regenerated
   `site/public/changelog.html`), tag `v<version>`, and
   `git push origin main --follow-tags`.

## Step 4 — Ship all three stores

Start Safari first (it's the ~15-minute leg), then run Chrome and Firefox
while it archives.

**Safari — macOS + iOS/iPadOS (local):**
1. Preflight BOTH platforms BEFORE archiving — a doomed submission should fail
   in seconds, not after a 15-minute build:
   `./scripts/submit-appstore.rb --platform=MAC_OS --preflight` and
   `./scripts/submit-appstore.rb --platform=IOS --preflight`.
2. `./scripts/release-safari.sh` (sync + archive + upload **both** platforms;
   run in background and monitor). Never auto-retry it on failure — show the
   output and stop.
3. Submit each platform (both read the same `.last-build-number`):
   `./scripts/submit-appstore.rb --platform=MAC_OS --release-type=<MANUAL|AFTER_APPROVAL>`
   then `./scripts/submit-appstore.rb --platform=IOS --release-type=<…>`. Each
   polls build processing, attaches the build, submits for review. If one fails
   mid-submission it has already saved the metadata; finish at the App Store
   Connect link it prints.

**Chrome (GitHub Actions):**
1. `gh workflow run cws-release.yml` then watch it
   (`gh run watch $(gh run list --workflow=cws-release.yml -L1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')`).
   The workflow self-gates on the version change and both uploads and
   publishes (submits for review) in one run.
2. Confirm with `./scripts/cws-status.sh` — expect `submittedVersion` =
   new version and `pendingReview: true`.

**Firefox (local):**
1. `./scripts/release-firefox.sh` — stages the extension (keeping
   `background.scripts`; only the Chrome zip strips it), lints, and submits a
   listed version with the release notes attached. AMO auto-publishes after
   validation, usually within minutes; the script does not wait for approval.

## Step 5 — Report

End with a per-store summary: version, state, and where to check:
- Chrome: pending review — https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole or
  `./scripts/cws-status.sh`
- Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addons (auto-publishes
  after validation)
- Safari: the App Store Connect link printed by `submit-appstore.rb` for each
  platform (macOS and iOS are separate review submissions). With MANUAL release
  timing, remind the user to click "Release this version" on each after Apple
  approves.

Note that the stores approve at different speeds — versions briefly diverging
across stores is normal.

## Important rules

- Never release from a dirty tree or off `main`. Never skip the release-notes
  roll or the user's version confirmation.
- `manifest.json` is the only place the version is edited by hand;
  `sync-safari.sh` owns `MARKETING_VERSION`.
- Never pass `-authenticationKey*` flags to xcodebuild — the ASC API key lacks
  cloud-signing permission; Xcode's signed-in session handles signing.
- Never auto-retry `release-safari.sh` or re-dispatch `cws-release.yml` on
  failure without showing the user what happened first.

## First-run setup (one-time, per machine)

- **Firefox:** create an AMO API key at
  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/ and copy
  `.env.amo.example` → `.env.amo`. Before the first automated submission,
  verify the AMO listing for `knockoff@knockoff.shopping` is complete in the
  Developer Hub (categories, summary, license) — `node scripts/render-listing.js`
  prints the copy to paste.
- **Safari:** create `.env.asc` with `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`,
  `ASC_KEY_FILE` — same App Store Connect API key as keptwell (shared Sabotage
  Media team `W33JZPPPFN`); copy the values from keptwell's `.env`.
- **Chrome:** already set up — GitHub secrets uploaded via
  `scripts/upload-secrets.sh` from `.env.cws`.
